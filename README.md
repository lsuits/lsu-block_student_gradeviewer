# Mentor Assignment

Mentor Assignment is a Moodle block that provides an administrative
interface for users to assign mentors to students, sport categories, or
academic categories.

The block makes heavy use of specific user meta data filled in with [UES][ues].
Once mentors are correctly provisioned, they can view grades for their
apprpriate students with the [UES Data Viewer][ues_meta_viewer].
